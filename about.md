I'm a mathematician and programmer working in data science. 

I'm currently at [Crowe LLP](https://www.crowe.com/), and was formerly Director of Data Science at Open Data Group (since renamed to [ModelOp](https://www.modelop.com/)). In a previous life, I studied [the geometry of string physics](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/10/232).
